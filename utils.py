# Why @wraps matters:
# - Without @wraps:
#       Flask registers the wrapped function under the name "wrapper"
#       Then url_for("<bp>.test") fails
#       because the endpoint is "wrapper", not "test"
# - With @wraps(view_func):
#       The wrapper keeps the original functionâ€™s identity
#       (name/module/doc), so the endpoint stays "test" and url_for(...) works.

    This decorator ensures that only logged-in users can access a route.

    The function checks if "user_id" exists in the session. If it does,
    the original route function runs. If not, the user is redirected to
    the login page, with the "next" parameter set to the current request
    path. The @wraps decorator is used so the wrapped function keeps its
    original identity (important for Flask's url_for).

    Check the number of characters in an input fit to the maximum length
